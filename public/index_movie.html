<h1>The Best Movies According to Tim</h1>
<h2>My top 4 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Remember the Titans</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie of all. A mix of brotherhood and camaraderie, centered around unity in sports.</p>
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>The greatest single acting performance I've ever seen with Heath Ledger and the Joker.</p>
<h3>Happy Gilmore</h3>
<p>I can watch this over and over again!</p>
<h3>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</h3>
<p> Here are some main reasons why: <br />
<br />
1. I love Snape in this movie.<br />
2. I love the innocence, yet complexity of this movie.<br />
3. I love Dumbledore - he's the best Dumbledore.<br />
